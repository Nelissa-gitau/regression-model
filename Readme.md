# Accident Data Analysis with Linear Regression

This project is a Python script that demonstrates how to perform linear regression analysis on accident data and visualize the results using the scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze accident data that includes the number of persons involved in accidents and the corresponding number of deaths. The goal is to build a linear regression model to predict the number of deaths based on the number of persons involved in accidents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, you should have the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/accident-data-analysis.git
cd accident-data-analysis
```

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python accident_analysis.py
```

3. The script will display a scatter plot of the data points and the linear regression line. It will also provide the regression equation.

4. You can make predictions by modifying the `persons_involved` variable in the script and running it again.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:

- `DATA`: Month or "TOTAL"
- `No of persons involved in accidents(X)`: Number of persons involved in accidents
- `Death(Y)`: Number of deaths
- `X^2`: Square of the number of persons involved in accidents
- `Y^2`: Square of the number of deaths
- `X*Y`: Product of the number of persons involved and the number of deaths

## Results

The project provides a linear regression model to predict the number of deaths based on the number of persons involved in accidents. It also visualizes the data points and the regression line.
